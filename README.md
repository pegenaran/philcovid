using jupyter notebook to create a list of web links that were acquired from feedly (feedly code is not in the repo)
this isn't much, just something to save me time when generating the html links in the proper format
the list of htmls will change frequently
it did take some digging to figure out how to get jupyter to do exactly what I wanted it to do and I am new at it
